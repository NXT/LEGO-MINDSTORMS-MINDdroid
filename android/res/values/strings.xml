        MINDdroid is an Android Application for the real-time direct action remote
        control of LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robots utilizing direct BlueTooth wireless
        connection between both devices - Android phone and your NXT robot and built-in 
        accelerometer and tilt sensors found on most Android powered hand-held phones 
        and devices.\n
        No computer or programming needed. Just make sure that your NXT robot 
        is on and has BlueTooth switched on and it is paired to your hand-held device or a
        phone beforehand. In the menu the middle button enables you to connect to your
        NXT robot model. It takes about 2-3 seconds to connect. And it takes 2 to dance...    
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_b">    
        It interacts in a real-time with NXT robot models built to drive and shoot or
        drive and throw or drive and hit or just drive. By tilting your mobile device down
        it moves forward. Tilting it up makes your NXT robot model move in the opposite direction
        or backwards.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_c1">
        Twisting your hand to the left, it will make your robot turn left and if you twist 
        right - it will turn right. Easy.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_c2">
        It has an <b>Action button</b> with two functions: On <b>short press</b> it triggers the motor dedicated
        for doing simple tasks. For the Shooterbot and the Tribot it drives the motor 180° forward 
        and back and for the Robogator the mouth will open and close three times. On <b>long press</b> you will
        be able to select and start a program on the NXT brick, isn\'t that fantastic? It works really
        well with the easy-to-build starter model Shooterbot, the 8527 Tribot built and the Robogator 
        from the instructions. Just select your robot type via the menu button on your Android phone
        when you are on the "Tutorial/Start" screen.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_d">    
        With the help of advanced firmware for NXT - leJOS NXJ (see http://www.lejos.org) you will be able 
        to control other robot models like our famed AlphaRex. Also you can have read-out of UltraSonic sensor
        reading the distance between your robot and an object or a wall, or your robot can recognize 
        colors and can read them out to you on your phone. Moreover, you can upload leJOS files (.nxj)  
        directly from your device to your robot. Last but not the least, we supplied two .nxj 
        files - AlphaRex and MINDGameZ with which, we hope, you can have hours of fun with your NXT.
        You will find printable tracks for MINDGameZ on http://mindstorms.com. But it\'s also fun to
        construct new tracks with a thick black marker on a huge sheet of packaging paper... 
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_e">    
        It indicates the direction you are tilting your hand-held device in and the direction
        your NXT robot moves. Short haptic feedback indicates that you just started driving around.
        Holding your phone flat in your palm will make NXT robot stand still.  The more you tilt,
        the faster the robot moves and the faster the square blinks. Cool, huh?    
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_f">    
        Because we can. And we think it is fun. Moreover, it will inspire you and many others
        to start building cool Applications for interacting with NXT and Android devices and even
        more cool LEGO MINDSTORMS robots. Because you can!\n\nNow go, try it out, have fun,
        play well and do not forget to visit us at http://mindstorms.com for more news,
        info and upcoming appies and goodies.
