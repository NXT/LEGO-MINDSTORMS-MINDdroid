        MINDdroid is LEGO® interactive remote control application for LEGO® MINDSTORMS® NXT robots.\n 
        With direct BlueTooth connection MINDdroid is using built-in accelerometer and tilt sensors 
        on your Android devices to drive your LEGO robot around.\n No computer or programming is needed
        as MINDdroid Universal Uploader enables you to upload files directly from your phone to your robot
        and run them instantly.\nPlease make sure that your NXT robot has BlueTooth on and it is paired to 
        your phone or a tablet beforehand.\n 
        In the menu the left button enables you to connect to your NXT robot model. 
        It takes about 2-3 seconds to connect and you are ready to play well...    
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_b">    
        It interacts in a real-time with NXT robot models built to drive and shoot or
        drive and throw or drive and hit or just drive. By tilting your mobile device down
        it moves forward. Tilting it up makes your NXT robot model move in the opposite direction
        or backwards. 
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_c1">
        Twisting your hand to the left, it will make your NXT robot turn left and if you twist 
        right - it will turn right. It is easy.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_c2">
        It has an <b>Action button</b> and when shortly pressed triggers the motor dedicated for doing simple tasks. 
        For the Shooterbot and the Tribot it drives the motor 180° forward and back and for the Robogator 
        the mouth will open and close three times. Isn\'t that cool?\n 
        You can reverse action by pressing the <b>Action button</b> somewhat longer.
        It works really well with the easy-to-build starter model Shooterbot, the 8527 Tribot and the Robogator 
        from the LEGO MINDSTORMS building instructions. Just select your robot type via the menu button on your Android phone
        when you are on the <b>Tutorial-Start</b> screen.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_d">    
        With the help of advanced firmware for NXT - leJOS NXJ (see http://www.lejos.org) you will be able 
        to control other robot models like our famed AlphaRex. With leJOS in place of original LEGO firmware 
        you can have read-out of UltraSonic sensor,reading the distance between your NXT robot and an object or a wall,
        Your robot can also recognize colors and can read them out aloud to you via speaker on your phone.\n 
        Best of all, you can upload files directly from your phone or tablet to your NXT robot and start them remotely.
        Last but not the least, we supplied two (2) .nxj files - AlphaRex and MINDGameZ, and five (5) .rxe files - Pong, 
        NXTCounter, Block, LineFollower, Robogator.
        With those files you can have at an instant hours of fun with your NXT robot.\n 
        You can start those via <b>Menu -> Start Program</b> button. You can stop only AlphaRex and MINDGameZ programs 
        in leJOS firmware by pressing the <b>Menu -> Start Program</b> for the second time.\n\n 
        <i>You will find printable tracks for MINDGameZ on http://mindstorms.com. But it could be fun to try to 
        construct new tracks with a thick black marker on a huge sheet of paper or a black tape on the floor.</i> 
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_e">    
        It indicates the direction you are tilting your hand-held device in and the direction
        your NXT robot moves. Short haptic feedback indicates that you just started driving around.
        Holding your phone flat in your palm will make NXT robot stand still.  The more you tilt,
        the faster the NXT robot moves and the faster the square blinks. Cool, huh?    
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_f">    
        Because we can. And we think it is fun. Moreover, it will inspire you and many others
        to start building cool Applications for interacting with NXT robots and Android devices and even
        more cool LEGO MINDSTORMS robots. Because <b>you</b> can!\n\nNow go, try it out, have fun,
        play well and do not forget to visit us at http://mindstorms.com for more news,
        info and upcoming apps and goodies.
